# This-is-exciting
Hi, my name is Hani, short for Hania. 
Welcome to my GitHub repository! This is my first time learning programming, and to be honest, I thought it was going to be boring. But once I started to dive into Python and explore what I could create, I was hooked. I even started creating games using Python, but I'm still figuring out how to publish them.

As a data analyst, I've been using a variety of tools and techniques to explore and analyze data. I've become proficient in using pandas, Jupyter notebooks, and MySQL to clean and manipulate data. I've also been having a lot of fun creating all kinds of charts and visualizations to help tell the story behind the data.

In this repository, you'll find some of my latest data analysis projects, where I've applied my skills and knowledge to real-world datasets. I'm excited to share my work with you and welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have. Thank you for visiting my page!
